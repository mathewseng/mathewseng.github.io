# Edge the Dealer - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Overview

Edge the Dealer is a multiplayer 5-card draw poker variant played with 1-9 players over peer-to-peer WebRTC connections (PeerJS). Players compete against a shared dealer hand and each other, with a unique twist: if anyone beats the dealer, the **lowest** hand among those that beat the dealer wins. If nobody beats the dealer, the **highest** player hand wins. The game features configurable multi-draw rounds (1-4), simultaneous play, and a pot-based payout system.

---

## 2. Core Game Rules

### 2.1 Basic Setup
- **Players**: 1-9 players (9 × 5 cards + 7 dealer cards = 52 total)
- **Cards**: Standard 52-card deck
- **Player Cards**: Each player receives 5 cards (private)
- **Dealer Cards**: 7 cards dealt face-up (visible to all players)
- **Dealer Hand**: Best 5-card poker hand from the 7 dealer cards (auto-evaluated)
- **Ante**: All players bet equally (configurable base bet, default $1.00)

### 2.2 Betting Structure
- **Base Bet**: Configurable by host (default $1.00, supports 2 decimal places)
- **All players bet equally** - flat ante, no raises or additional betting streets
- **No folding** - all players must play every hand they are dealt into

### 2.3 Game Phases

| Phase | State | Player Action |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| **Deal** | 5 cards to each player, 7 to dealer | View cards, see dealer's 7 cards |
| **Draw Round 1** | First draw round | Select 0-5 cards to discard, then confirm |
| **Draw Round 2-4** | Additional draw rounds (if configured) | Select 0-5 cards to discard, then confirm |
| **Showdown** | All draws complete | Results displayed, PnL calculated |

### 2.4 Draw Rounds
- Host configures the number of draw rounds: **Single** (1), **Double** (2), **Triple** (3), or **Quadruple** (4).
- In each draw round:
  1. Each player selects 0-5 cards to discard.
  2. Each player confirms their selection.
  3. Once **all** players confirm, discards and replacements execute simultaneously.
  4. If the deck runs out of cards, all previously discarded cards are reshuffled into the deck.
- After all draw rounds complete, the game proceeds to showdown.

### 2.5 Winning Conditions

All players are ranked by **standard high poker hand strength**.

**If one or more players beat the dealer:**
> The winner is the **lowest** hand among those that beat the dealer.
> This is the core "edge" mechanic — you want to *just barely* beat the dealer, not crush them.

**If nobody beats the dealer:**
> The winner is the **highest** player hand.

**Ties:**
> If multiple players have the same winning hand strength, the pot is split equally among them.

### 2.6 Hand Rankings (High to Low)

| Rank | Hand | Example |
|------|------|---------|
| 10 | Royal Flush | A♠ K♠ Q♠ J♠ T♠ |
| 9 | Straight Flush | 9♥ 8♥ 7♥ 6♥ 5♥ |
| 8 | Quads | K♠ K♥ K♦ K♣ 2♠ |
| 7 | Boat | A♠ A♥ A♦ K♠ K♥ |
| 6 | Flush | A♣ J♣ 8♣ 6♣ 2♣ |
| 5 | Straight | T♠ 9♥ 8♦ 7♣ 6♠ |
| 4 | Trips | 7♠ 7♥ 7♦ K♠ 3♣ |
| 3 | Two Pair | A♠ A♥ 8♦ 8♣ 4♠ |
| 2 | Pair | Q♠ Q♥ 9♦ 5♣ 2♠ |
| 1 | High Card | A♠ J♥ 8♦ 5♣ 3♠ |

## 3. Payout System

### 3.1 Core Principle
- **Multiplayer (2+ players)**: Pot-based game. All antes go into the pot; winners split the pot.
- **Single Player**: Play against the dealer as a virtual **bank**.

### 3.2 Single Player Mode (vs Bank)

When playing solo, the dealer acts as the bank:

| Player vs Dealer | Result |
|------------------|--------|
| **Player beats dealer** | Win: `+bet` |
| **Player does not beat dealer** | Lose: `-bet` |

### 3.3 Multiplayer Payout Rules

**Pot Calculation:**
> `Total Pot = sum of all player bets`

**Winner Determination:**
1. Evaluate all player hands against dealer.
2. If any players beat the dealer → winner is the **lowest** hand among beaters.
3. If no players beat the dealer → winner is the **highest** hand overall.
4. If multiple players tie for the winning hand → split pot equally among them.

**Payout:**
> Each winner receives: `Total Pot / number of winners`
> Each player's net result: `winnings received - bet paid`

### 3.4 Payout Calculation Algorithm

```javascript
// Determine winners
const beatingPlayers = players.filter(p => p.beatsDealer);
let winnerIds = [];

if (beatingPlayers.length > 0) {
    // Lowest hand among those beating dealer
    const lowestBeater = pickLowestHand(beatingPlayers);
    winnerIds = beatingPlayers
        .filter(p => compareHands(p.hand, lowestBeater.hand) === 0)
        .map(p => p.id);
} else {
    // Highest hand when nobody beats dealer
    const highestHand = pickHighestHand(allPlayers);
    winnerIds = allPlayers
        .filter(p => compareHands(p.hand, highestHand.hand) === 0)
        .map(p => p.id);
}

// Calculate payouts
const totalPot = players.reduce((sum, p) => sum + p.bet, 0);
const winnerCount = winnerIds.length;

for (const player of players) {
    const isWinner = winnerIds.includes(player.id);
    const winnings = isWinner ? totalPot / winnerCount : 0;
    player.netResult = winnings - player.bet;
    player.pnl += player.netResult;
}
```

### 3.5 Examples

**Example 1: 3 Players — One Beats Dealer (Lowest Wins)**
- Dealer: Two Pair (Aces and Kings)
- Player A: Trips (beats dealer) — bet $1
- Player B: Flush (beats dealer) — bet $1
- Player C: Pair (does not beat dealer) — bet $1
- Total Pot: $3

Players A and B both beat the dealer. Player A has the **lower** hand (Trips < Flush), so Player A wins.

**Result:**
- Player A: $3 - $1 = **+$2**
- Player B: $0 - $1 = **-$1**
- Player C: $0 - $1 = **-$1**
- **Total: $0** ✓

**Example 2: 3 Players — Nobody Beats Dealer (Highest Wins)**
- Dealer: Flush
- Player A: Two Pair — bet $1
- Player B: Trips — bet $1
- Player C: Pair — bet $1
- Total Pot: $3

Nobody beats the dealer. Player B has the **highest** hand (Trips), so Player B wins.

**Result:**
- Player A: $0 - $1 = **-$1**
- Player B: $3 - $1 = **+$2**
- Player C: $0 - $1 = **-$1**
- **Total: $0** ✓

**Example 3: 2 Players — Tie**
- Dealer: Straight
- Player A: Flush (beats dealer) — bet $1
- Player B: Flush of same rank (beats dealer) — bet $1
- Total Pot: $2

Both players beat dealer with equal hands → split pot.

**Result:**
- Player A: $1 - $1 = **$0**
- Player B: $1 - $1 = **$0**
- **Total: $0** ✓

**Example 4: Single Player — Beats Dealer**
- Dealer: Two Pair
- Player: Trips — bet $2

Player beats dealer → wins bet from bank.

**Result:**
- Player: **+$2**

**Example 5: Single Player — Loses to Dealer**
- Dealer: Flush
- Player: Two Pair — bet $2

Player does not beat dealer → loses bet to bank.

**Result:**
- Player: **-$2**

### 5.3 State Management

**Player Object (internal):**
```javascript
{
    id: string,              // PeerJS ID
    pnl: number,            // Current profit/loss (starts at 0)
    startingPnl: number,    // PnL at hand start (for display during hand)
    holeCards: Card[],       // 5 cards
    totalBet: number,        // Bet this hand (= baseBet)
    hasConfirmed: boolean,   // Confirmed this draw round?
    pendingDiscards: number[] // Indices of cards to discard
}
```

**Game State (broadcast):**
```javascript
{
    phase: 'waiting' | 'draw' | 'results',
    baseBet: number,
    drawCount: number,          // Total draw rounds (1-4)
    currentDrawRound: number,   // Current round (1-based)
    players: PlayerState[],     // All player states
    queuedPlayers: string[],    // IDs of queued players
    dealerCards: Card[],        // All 7 dealer cards
    dealerUsedCards: Card[],    // Best 5 cards
    dealerUnusedCards: Card[],  // Remaining 2 cards
    dealerBestHand: Hand,       // Evaluated dealer hand
    deckCount: number,          // Cards remaining in deck
    discardCount: number,       // Cards in discard pile
    results: Result[],          // Only at showdown
    resolutionType: string      // 'lowest_beating_dealer' or 'highest_when_no_one_beats_dealer'
}
```

**Result Object:**
```javascript
{
    playerId: string,
    holeCards: Card[],
    hand: { name: string, rank: number, value: number[] },
    beatsDealer: boolean,
    isWinner: boolean,
    totalBet: number,
    netResult: number    // +/- amount
}
```

### 5.4 Parallel Actions
- All players act simultaneously (not in turns)
- Players see `... Waiting` while others haven't confirmed, `✓ Confirmed` after confirming
- Draw round executes only when ALL players have confirmed
- `hasConfirmed` flag per player tracks confirmation status

### 5.5 Mid-Game Joins
- New players can join during a hand in progress
- They are queued (`queuedPlayers` array in game state)
- Added to game at start of next hand via `addQueuedPlayers()`
- UI shows them with "⏳ Waiting for next hand" status
- They can see the current game state, chat, and game log

### 5.6 Session Persistence & Reconnection

Players can refresh the page without losing their connection.

**How It Works:**

1. **Session Storage**: When a player connects, their session info is saved to `sessionStorage`:
   - `peerId` - Their PeerJS ID
   - `roomCode` - The room they're in
   - `playerName` - Their display name
   - `isHost` - Whether they're the host
   - `gameInProgress` - Whether a game is currently running
   - `timestamp` - For expiration (1 hour)

2. **On Page Load**: The app checks for an existing session and attempts to reconnect automatically.

3. **Host Reconnection**: Host reconnects using the same room code-based peer ID. If `gameInProgress` was true, host goes directly to game screen.

4. **Client Reconnection**: Client reconnects using the same peer ID. Host recognizes them and restores them to the game.

5. **Disconnection Grace Period**: When a player disconnects, host stores their info for 5 minutes. If they reconnect within that time, they're restored.

### 5.7 Host Migration

When the host disconnects, the system attempts reconnection first, then migrates to another host if needed.

**Flow:**
```
Host Disconnects
    ↓
Clients detect (conn.on('close'))
    ↓
Attempt reconnect every 1s (5 times)
    ↓
If reconnect succeeds → Send gameStateBackup to host → Resume
    ↓
If no reconnect → initiateHostMigration()
    ↓
First eligible player → becomeNewHost()
    ↓
Connect to all peers, send new_host_announcement
    ↓
Restore game state, continue game
```

## 6. Testing Scenarios

### 6.1 Payout Tests
1. **1 player beats dealer** - Winner gets entire pot
2. **Multiple players beat dealer** - Lowest hand among beaters wins pot
3. **Nobody beats dealer** - Highest hand wins pot
4. **All players tie** - Pot split equally (net $0 for everyone)
5. **2 players beat dealer, tied** - Split pot between both beaters
6. **Single player beats dealer** - Wins +bet from bank
7. **Single player loses to dealer** - Loses -bet to bank

### 6.2 Edge Cases
- **Maximum players (9)** - All 52 cards dealt (9×5 + 7 = 52), no cards in deck
- **Deck exhaustion during draws** - Discard pile reshuffled into deck mid-draw
- **0 discards confirmed** - Player keeps all cards (stand pat)
- **5 discards confirmed** - Player replaces entire hand
- **Player disconnects mid-hand** - Stored for reconnection, game continues
- **Player refreshes page** - Auto-reconnects using stored session
- **Host disconnects** - Host migration to next player
- **Player joins mid-hand** - Queued for next hand
- **All players discard all cards** - Heavy deck usage, may need reshuffle
- **Draw count change between hands** - Host adjusts for next hand

### 6.3 Resolution Type Verification
- When resolution is "lowest_beating_dealer": confirm the lowest hand among beaters is selected
- When resolution is "highest_when_no_one_beats_dealer": confirm the highest overall hand is selected
- Verify `sum(all netResults) === 0` for multiplayer hands
